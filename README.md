# Python Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Python, along with solutions to LeetCode problems.


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:timilehinjegede/ds.algos.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd ds.algos
```

3. Run individual algorithms:
```bash
# To run sorting algorithms
python sorting/<algorithm_name>.py

# To run LeetCode solutions
python leetcode/arrays/<problem_name>.py
```

Each algorithm and solution is implemented as a standalone script that can be run independently.
